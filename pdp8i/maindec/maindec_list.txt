8I-D0BA extended arithmetic PDP-8/I instruction test - part 3B
    If interrupt interaction is to be tested, load any tape in tape reader
    and turn it on. Load address 0200, press start, program halts at loc 0200.
    Set any desired options in SR and press continue. The program will halt at
    program end halt (loc 0256) after last routine has been executed, provided
    no loop options have been set.
    SR0: Halt after current routine. Program halts at completion of current
         test routine. The AC displays number of completed routine.
    SR1: Select routine. The program jumps to routine whose number is set in
         SR9 through SR11. Routine selection occurs at start of program, or at
         completion of current routine.
    SR2: Loop routine. Current routine is repeated.
    SR3: Loop program. Entire program is repeated.
    SR4: Lock on test. The test currently being executed is repeated.
    SR5=0 Print on error.
    SR5=1 Halt on error.
    SR6: Halt after print. Program halts after error printout.
    SR7: Print failure rate. The program prints the number of failures per
         hundred repetitions of same test. Program halts after the printout.
         SR5 must be set to 0 for the printout to occur.
    SR8: Print simulation and/or enter 'scope loop. For routines 0 and 1
         program prints multiply simulation and enters multiply 'scope loop.
         For routines 2 and 3 program prints divide simulation and enters
         divide 'scope loop. For routines 4 through 7 program enters the 
         exerciser 'scope loop for individual routine. SR5 must be set to 0
         for this option to become active.
    SR9 through SR11: Routine number. These switches specify the number of
         routine to be selected. SR1 must be on to select a routine.
